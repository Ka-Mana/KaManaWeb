# Building PISALE on KOA HPC
As part of the Earthshots grant, my advisor Monique Chyba has been tasked with designing a summer intensive workshop around numerical methods and high-performance computing. It will have students learn how to use super-computing to solve problems. To do so, students will need access to a super computer. In the process of selecting a cluster, I have rebuilt PISALE with help from the team using a quick patch.
```
#assume git directory is in ~/pisale
cd ~
#load some modules
module load compiler/GCC/12.2.0
module load mpi/OpenMPI/4.1.4-GCC-12.2.0
module load numlib/GSL/2.7-GCCcore-12.2.0
module load tools/git
module load lang/Python
#start a new session on a sandbox node
srun -N 1 -n 16 -c 1 -p sandbox -t 1:00:00 --mem=16G --pty /bin/bash
#install new versions of meson and ninja; the ones in the module are old
pip install meson
pip install ninja
#set up "build root", where downloaded source goes
mkdir zzz
export BUILDROOT=$(pwd)/zzz
cd pisale
git checkout update_meson
#make sure the subprojects aren't fucked
rm -rf subprojects
#meson should do everything automagically
meson setup build --prefix=$BUILDROOT/zzz --buildtype=release
cd build
ninja
#this will build 2d-opt
#to build 3d-opt, edit meson.options and set the first line to have 2 instead of 3 in the value
#to build {n}d-debug, I think do --buildtype=debug?
```

Another addition to the project is this very website. In building this site, I have learned a lot about markdown and using the mkdocs tool.
